2/18/20: I've gotten the model to run. However, there are a few bugs that need to be worked out:
	1. For some reason the update function is not worked as I'd like it to. It seems to be 
misbehaving when interactions, firings, hirings, and resignations occur. When individuals are added
to the organization's workforce, we have 1K individuals. This should remain constant. For some 
reason, though, it isn't. This means, likely, that I'm not decrementing everywhere I should be. 
Perhaps in the resignation function? 
	2. For some reason, negative n_* values were being achieved. This doesn't make any sense, 
since for this to happen, a resignation or interaction-as-listener needs to take place for a 
worldview that isn't represented in the organization. That is, a non-existent individual is having 
his mind changed or is resigning or is being fired from the organization. 

It's good, however, that the model is at least working. Up next, once these bugs are fixed, is 
parameter tuning, which I'm excited about. What distribution should be used for the threshold 
parameters? Further, what should be threshold buckets be for zealot_resistance_probabilities? And, 
finally, what is a better measure for polarization than simple 1-n_AB? These are all good questions
that need to be answered. Once they are, then I can develop a nice interface with which to nicely 
run experiments

2/21/20: The code is now fully debugged and working. The main error fixed today was particularly 
frustrating, although I learned quite a bit from it: 

I originally updated the configuration of the organization's workforce using an update_config() 
function. Statistical information about the workforce was stored as fields (n_*, N_*, polarization,
 etc.). The update_config() function then either incremented or decremented the count of individual
 with a particular worldview when a change in the workforce took place -- hiring, firing, 
interaction, resignation. It's unclear why, but this resulted in an out-of-sync issue between the 
statistical information about the workforce and the workforce itself. Particular worldviews would 
be detected in the workforce and selected for resignation or firing even when the count with respect
 to their worldview had been driven to zero already. This meant that worldview counts were negative
 given enough epochs. This was solved simply by simplifying the organization class with a 
get_statistics() function that reads in the workforce list and operates on it directly to recover 
all the relevant statistical information. get_statistics() was then called whenever the statistical
 information was required. This allowed the statistics and the workforce list (assuming the 
workforce list was updated correctly) to always be in sync. 

So, it looks like the model is now fully operational, and I can move on to the finer details. In 
particular: 
	1. Building a command line interface that I can use to efficiently run experiments 
	2. Developing a proper metric for polarization w/ range [0,1] that increases as components 
become more segregated 
	3. Finding the proper distributions for TOPP and THOM (in particular, think about TOPP for 
moderates and THOM for zealots)  
	4. Probabilities for SR and ASR	
	5. Developing the differential equations that predict the behavior we see 
	6. Building a pygame functionality so that the dynamics of the model can be visualized 

In addition, it is probably time to drop all the notes made thus far into a word doc and 
linguistically flush out the model. This will be a good way to get the ball rolling on the paper 
whose publication, I'm sure, is inevitable. Ha, laughable.
