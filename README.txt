I was inspired to create this project after witnessing an attempted hostile ideological takeover
of a prominent non-profit. In fact, the situation is pending. It just so happened that this 
took place immediately after I had read a number of papers regarding ideological population dynamics.
One simple model, in particular, that I took a liking to and that this work builds upon, is Steven
Strogatz's "Encouraging Moderation", which I've included here.
